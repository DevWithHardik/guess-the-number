🎯 Number Guessing Game – Python

This is a simple and interactive Number Guessing Game built using Python. The program randomly generates a number, and the player must guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback — telling the player to guess higher or lower — until the correct number is guessed. It also keeps track of how many attempts the user takes.

🔹 Features

Random number generation using the random module

User input via the terminal

Helpful feedback on each guess (Higher number please / Lower number please)

Tracks and displays the total number of attempts

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (No external libraries)

Developed using Visual Studio Code

🕹️ How It Works

The program picks a random number (e.g., between 1 and 100)

The player enters their guess

The program responds with:

"Higher number please" if the guess is too low

"Lower number please" if the guess is too high

"Correct!" when the guess is right

After guessing correctly, the total number of attempts is displayed
